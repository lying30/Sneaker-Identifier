# Sneaker-Identifier
This is a program that takes a trained dataset of Yeezy's and Offwhite sneakers to make a machine learning model that differentiates the two brands through image classification on the images. The lack of data in the dataset accounts for the low accuracy of the model, and if I were to improve the accuracy of the model I would add more images to the dataset.
